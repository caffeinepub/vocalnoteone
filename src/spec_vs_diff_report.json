  "summary": "The diff fully implements both requirements. REQ-1 is satisfied by automatically restarting speech recognition after note save (App.tsx lines 30-34 with 100ms delay). REQ-2 is satisfied by calling clearTranscript() before restart (line 28) and the clearTranscript function properly resetting all transcript state including finalTranscriptRef and interimTranscriptRef (useSpeechRecognition.ts). All acceptance criteria are met: input field clears after save, speech recognition remains active and ready, multiple consecutive recordings work without manual intervention, and transcript state starts clean for each new recording.",
